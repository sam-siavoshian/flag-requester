# Flag Collector 🇺🇳🚀

Need flags from around the world?  
Want to politely ask embassies to send you a tiny piece of their country?  

**This script has you covered!**

---

## What it does:  
- Reads a list of countries and embassy emails  
- Sends a polite, charming email requesting a small flag  
- Handles multiple emails per country like a pro  
- Saves you from writing the same message a million times  

---

## How to use it:  
1. Put embassy emails in `embassies.csv` (one row per country, emails comma-separated)  
2. Add your mailing address in the script  
3. Run it and watch the flags roll in! (Well, the emails at least)  

---

## WARNING ⚠️  
This script does NOT actually *send* flags for you. You’ll still have to wait for the postman.  

---

## Bonus tip:  
If you want a flag, just ask nicely. Works almost every time.

Happy flag hunting! 🇺🇸🇯🇵🇫🇷🇿🇦

*P.S. If you get 50 flags before me, I will be jealous.*
