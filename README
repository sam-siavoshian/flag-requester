# Flag Collector 🚀

A small script to help you politely request tiny flags from embassies around the world.

---

## Features

- 📑 Reads a CSV of countries and embassy emails  
- ✉️ Sends a polite, customizable request for a small flag  
- 🤹‍♂️ Supports multiple addresses per country  
- ⏱️ Saves you from copy-pasting the same message repeatedly  

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or newer  
- Access to an SMTP server (e.g. Gmail, Outlook)  

---

## Usage

```bash
python flag_collector.py
```

You’ll see each email that has been sent in your console.

---

## embassies.csv Format

No header row—just:

```csv
Country Name,email1@example.com,email2@example.com
Another Country,contact@embassy.org
```

---


## Troubleshooting

- ✅ Verify your SMTP credentials and server settings  
- 🔒 If using Gmail, enable “Less secure app access” or create an App Password  
- 📄 Ensure `embassies.csv` is UTF-8 encoded
